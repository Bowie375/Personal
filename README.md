# PKU WARCRAFT---More Like A String Game
---
## Introduction
Warcraft is a coding exercise developed by PKU (when I am a freshman), and I opened this repository to record my <br/>
juvenile happiness after solving this exercise, as this was my first time to write a lengthy code.<br/><br/>

Here are the links to the four stages of warcraft:
* [STAGE 1](http://cxsjsx.openjudge.cn/2023hwall/010/)
* [STAGE 2](http://cxsjsx.openjudge.cn/2023hwall/018/)
* [STAGE 3](http://cxsjsx.openjudge.cn/2023hwall/024/)
* [STAGE 4](http://cxsjsx.openjudge.cn/2023hwall/019/)<br/><br/>
