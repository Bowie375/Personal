## Introduction
This is a diffrrent kind of GO game, designed by [PKU](https://www.pku.edu.cn).

The whole game is writen in C++

## Some words to say
This is a project I made for the finalterm evaluation in my first college year. 

Lack of coding experience, unfamiliar with UI designing, all these led to this immature and juvenile piece of work. 
But it's still worth rememberring, so I store it here.

_Dare you see your first big program again ?_\^_^
