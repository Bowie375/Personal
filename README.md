## Introduction
This is a 2D, pixel style game called __"Heros vs Zombies"__. It resembles the game  __SUPER_MARIO__  in many ways.

This whole game is writen in python.

## How to play ?
  1. First, make sure you have python environment on your computer, and it should be equipped with __pygame__ packet.<br/>
     My version of python is 3.11.7

  2. Second, download the _HerosvsZombies.zip_ package to a safe directory and unzip it.

  3. In your command prompt, type
  ```cmd
    > python level_1.py
  ```     
  4. The whole game is played on keyboard, mouse events are not accepted.<br/>
     * _a_ and _d_ : move hero in left and right direction.
     * _w_ and _s_ : move cursor on the screen to choose modes.
     * _j_ : attack
     * _k_ : jump
     * _u_, _i_ and _o_ : special skills

  5. More details and game configurations are recorded in the README file included in the zip file.

## Some words to say
The reason why I made this is that when I attended a class in [PKU](https://www.pku.edu.cn), we were required to make a simple game as the homework.

I was motivated by [this repository](https://github.com/TobyfoxpurePython/-python), which facsimiled the classic [SUPER_MARIO_BROTHER](https://supermarioplay.com/) game all in python. That was a nice try,<br/>
really fascinating and pretty cool. So I download his work and made modiications on it, then this game __Hero vs Zombies__ came out. <br/>Much thanks to  the original author.

I spent nearly two weeks on the main frame, during which I thought of nothing but coding, that was really crazy!<br/>
This is my first time to make a game by myself, and it's quite a lot of fun. Anyway, to some extend, it finished one of my small dreams.

_Try something you always want but afraid, suprise will finally arive!_\^_^
